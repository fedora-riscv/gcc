summary: Fortran DW_TAG_common_block has incorrect placement/scope
description: |+
    Problem: gcc-4.3.2 / gfortran-4.3.2 (in the forthcoming tech-preview for
    RHEL5.3) appears to also have the "DW_TAG_common_block has incorrect
    placement/scope" issues listed in the following gcc upstream bug:

    http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37738

    What gfortran is doing currently is:

    (1) Merges all common blocks into a single one.
    (2) Places this single common block into the first subroutine where it was
    used.
