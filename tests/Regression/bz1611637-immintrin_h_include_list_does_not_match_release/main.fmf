    Bug summary: devtoolset-8-gcc includes avx512vbmi2intrin.h but does not contain it
    Bugzilla link: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1611637

    The list of intrinsic headers keeps changing every release, sometimes
    even on the release branch, and %files needs to be in sync with what has
    been changed in gcc/config.gcc. immintrin.h is one of those headers and
    this test makes sure that we can #include it.
