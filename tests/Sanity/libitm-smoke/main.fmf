summary: Just runs prebuilt binaries
description: |
    Just running prebuilt binaries that require libitm.
    This test is designed to run in gcc-libraries CI. we
    cannot build anything on our own, since we don't have
    devtoolset's gcc and -devel libraries.

    This should run OK on RHEL-6 and RHEL-7, currently all
    arches.

    The sources of the tests are in Sanity/libitm-sanity.
    !!! THIS TEST IS INTENTIONALLY NOT IN gcc General PLAN !!!
